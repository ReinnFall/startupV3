# startupV3 - Pokemon Catch
## Specification Deliverable

### Elevator Pitch 

Pokemon, a game that has captured the minds and attention of people for decades, still continues to remain fresh and exciting. For big time collectors and horders, this game is a dream. My startup project will bring this magic and excitement right from your browser. My app will allow users to again collect all of the original 151 pokemon with only a few clicks. Encounter, catch and show off your Pokemon to all your friends and relive the undying magic of Pokemon.

### Key Features
- Ability to encounter and catch Pokemon
- Personal collection page
- Pokedex Page that shows what you have caught and what you are missing
- Ability to share catches with others

###
### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways:

- **HTML** - My startup with span four different pages (Login, Catch, Collection and Pokedex)
- **CSS** - I will include an animation of a Poke ball shaking and catching a Pokemon
- **React** - Clicking the Encounter button will interact with page and show a hidden Pokemon, pressing catch will add that Pokemon to a database tied to the player
- **Services** - App will connect with graphql-pokeapi to retrieve specific information about each Pokemon including type and pokedex entries.
- **DB/Authentication** - Each player will log in and have a record of each Pokemon that have caught and who they are missing
- **WebSocket** - A message will appear on the catch page when other users succesfully caught a Pokemon.
