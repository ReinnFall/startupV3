# startupV3 - Pokemon Catch
## Specification Deliverable

### Elevator Pitch 

Pokemon, a game that has captured the minds and attention of people for decades, still continues to remain fresh and exciting. For big time collectors and horders, this game is a dream. My startup project will bring this magic and excitement right to your browser. My app will allow users to collect all of the original 151 Pokemon with only a few clicks. Encounter, catch and show off your Pokemon to all your friends and relive the undying magic of Pokemon.

### Key Features
- Ability to encounter and catch Pokemon
- Personal collection page
- Pokedex page that shows what you have caught and what you are missing
- Ability to share catches with others
- Free encounter/catch every 3 hours

###
### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways:

- **HTML** - My startup will span four different pages (Login, Catch, Collection and Pokedex). Hyperlinks between pages except initial login page.
- **CSS** - I will include an animation of a Poke ball shaking and catching a Pokemon. Decorated tables of Pokemon caught and missing.
- **React** - Clicking the Encounter button will interact with the page and show a hidden Pokemon. Pressing catch will add that Pokemon to a database tied to the player
- **Services** - App will connect with graphql-pokeapi to retrieve specific information about each Pokemon including type and pokedex entries.
- **DB/Authentication** - Each player will log in and have a record of each Pokemon that they have caught and who they are missing
- **WebSocket** - A message will appear on the catch page when other users succesfully caught a Pokemon (forgot to add this to my design jpg but it will be there)

## HTML deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following:

- [x] **HTML pages** - Four different pages. One for each view. `index.html` (Login), `catch.html`, `collection.html`, and `pokedex.html`.
- [x] **Proper HTML element usage** - I used header,footer, main, nav, img, a, and  button tags throughout my HTML files.
- [x] **Links** - Links between views.
- [x] **Text** - Catch page has text showing who has caught a Pokemon.
- [x] **3rd party API placeholder** - My pokedex and collection pages are hard programmed right now. These will act as placeholders for the Pokemon API I will be using.
- [x] **Images** - The question mark image on the pokedex page will be used to show if the user has not caught that Pokemon yet. I have placeholder images on collection page.
- [x] **Login placeholder** - My home page (index.html) has a placeholder for login. I will change it during the CSS phase as right now it is the exact same as Simon's.
- [x] **DB data placeholder** - My collection and pokedex page both have very large hardcoded tables that act as placeholders for the data that will be stored in them. I will change the collection tables to allocate dynamically with javascript.
- [x] **WebSocket placeholder** - The Player Catches section on the catch page is a placeholder for future WebSocket implementation.

## CSS deliverable

For this deliverable, I did the following:

- [x] **Header, footer, and main content body** - Each HTML file has its own css file. Headers and footers are identical.
- [x] **Navigation elements** - All Navigation elements are on the top right of the page. They remain consistent between pages.
- [x] **Responsive to window resizing** - I used flex as well as sizing things with vh and vw.
- [x] **Application elements** - I centered most of my content in the middle of the page. Flex helped with this. I also used bootstrap on my login buttons.
- [x] **Application text content** - Changed all my text to this font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif. Not too crazy but I think it looks nice.
- [x] **Application images** - I adjusted tables and images within pokedex and collection pages to take up the full space in my main. 

## React P1 
For this deliverable, I did the following:

- [x] **Vite** - Application is bundled with vite.
- [x] **React Components** - I now have react components that contain my css and html.
- [x] **React Router** - I use BrowserRouter and Routes to make my website one page.
- [x] **CSS fixes** - I had to fix some issues with css interacting with other pages. 

## React P2
For this deliverable, I did the following:
- [x] **All functionality implemented or mocked out** - The main functionaility of catching a Pokemon on the catch page and then storing that Pokemon to the collection page is complete. I store the data using localStorage which will be changed. The login method is the same one used in simon. I have reviewed that code and understand how it works. I have also set up a setInterval function to mock how the catch messages will work when I implement the WebSocket phase. I have also decided to postpone the Pokedex functionality. There are no required features of the Pokedex section that I am not already doing. I will implement this for fun if I have time during this semester or after this class. 
- [x] **Hooks** - I use useState and useEffect in my implementation of the catch mechanic as well as the catch messages.

## ðŸš€ Service deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following.

- [x] **Node.js/Express HTTP service** - Installed Express with NPM. Default port on 4000.js. Found in index.js
- [x] **Static middleware for frontend** - Simple endpoints in service file - index.js.
- [x] **Calls to third party endpoints** - When a Pokemon is generated an api call is made from PokeAPI that retrieves the type of that Pokemon. That information is then saved and displayed in the collection page. 
- [x] **Backend service endpoints** - Simple endpoints in `service/index` for register, login, logout, add Pokemon, and get user's Pokemon.
- [x] **Frontend calls service endpoints** - All mocked functionality removed from the frontend and replaced with calls to the service. The collection page is loaded from a get request and my addPokemon function calls a post request.
- [x] **Supports registration, login, logout, and restricted endpoint** - User must login in now to be able to catch Pokemon and see their collection. Throws an error if the wrong password is entered or tries to login with an account taht isn't registered. My endpoints that are related to the users Pokemon are restricted with verifyAuth.

## ðŸš€ DB/Login deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. 

- [x] **Stores data in MongoDB** - User data and pokemon are stored in MongoDB in`service/database.js`. Each user now has a unique collection of Pokemon. When the user clicks on the collection page, their Pokemon from the database are loaded up rather than resetting each time the client resets.
- [x] **Stores credentials in MongoDB** - Auth stored in MongoDB from `service/database.js`. User login info persists even after client resets.
